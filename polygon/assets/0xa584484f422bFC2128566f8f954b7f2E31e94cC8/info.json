  "description": "$DOWN is an innovative experiment in social-token economics; wherein the ERC20 has been deployed by 'sharding' and NFT, and the underlying NFT functions as an inaccessible, multi-chain vault.  *Inaccessible to remove, trade, transfer or otherwise modify its' held assets.  Deposits are still viable.  In addition to a growing reserve of NFTs and fungible assets; the Emblem Vault under-pinning the value of $DOWN contains 10% of the tokens' supply; creating a positive and perpetual feedback loop of value accrual that we've dubbed \"quantum compounding\".

  "description": "Greenlyght Coin represents the bridge between crypto and cannabis, a merger unlike any company or project has done before. This is accomplished using our already-functional, groundbreaking utility backed by Greenlyght “The Delivery Company,” an established company going strong for over 5 years. For holders of Greenlyght Coin (GLC), that means the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of BUSD from real sales that Greenlyght makes. In addition to earning BUSD from a percentage of the sales that go through the Greenlyght Delivery Platform, holders can also earn free GLC by staking their coins in our complex, auto-compounding staking program. These two rewards programs go hand-in-hand and are explained in detail in our 2022 GLC Staking & Profit- Sharing Schedule On Our Website ",

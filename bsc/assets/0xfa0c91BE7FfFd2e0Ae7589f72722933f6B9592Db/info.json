  "description": "Silos Coin represents the beginning of the process of decentralization of the market that sustains the economy of Brazil, the AGRIBUSINESS, through a technology that offers more autonomy to the producers in the harvest, facilitating the conditions of storage and transport.Silos Coin foresees millionaire investments in the production of Mobile Silos, which can be rented by small, medium and large producers. Our technology allows the producer to make a silo lease agreement, where he will have the storage unit installed on his property, and the costs he has with this represent a negligible value per bag.In other words, the producer can work with more comfort, intelligence, flexibility, profitability, and Silos Coin investors have the return on their investment guaranteed by contract.",

  "description": "Millions of investors in crypto negatively were impacted and abandoned by LUNA, resulting in the birth of a new #LUNA community, or rather NEW COMMUNITY LUNA, ($CLUNA) Token Project. After a year, when LUNA experienced an unprecedented decline, the once-popular PIGTOKEN developer created the token $CLUNA. Similar to PIGTOKEN, $CLUNA has massive decentralization on a scale rarely seen in other tokens. Combine these three together and you get a powerhouse out of the hands of anyone, except the community as a whole.In a decentralized smart chain environment, we chose to burn liquidity forever to achieve token scarcity. The development defined, 2% of each transaction is sent to a burn address, which is publicly verifiable for all participants to see (reference BSCScan). Our developer formulated a liquidity-providing protocol to help stabilize the price floor. The $CLUNA token is a fair launch token, the liquidity is burned forever, (No marketing wallets) and ownership is renounced.",

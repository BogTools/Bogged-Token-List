  "description": "On the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Lucro is a first of its kind Ecosystem Token. Lucro has been designed for high volume trading, with multiple real world use cases being rolled out shortly after launch. 10,000,000,000 $LCR were sent to Pancake Swap Liquidity Pool and locked in a Pinksale Locker and 30,000,000,000 $LCR were retained in Treasury for a series of future features, including ongoing Burn, Airdrops, NFT utility (including vested airdrops), Staking, Team Rewards, Competitions and Marketing. A 1% tax is applied on all $LCR transactions, of which 0.2% goes to the Lucro Liquidity Pool, and 0.8% goes to the $EGC BuyBack & Burn function. An anti-whale function limits the maximum individual sell to 1,000,000,000 $LCR.",

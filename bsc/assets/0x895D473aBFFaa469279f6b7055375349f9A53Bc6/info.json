  "description": "Shiba Rewards was created out of frustration due to many new projects featuring high taxes with a majority collected going to the developers wallets rather than the investors. SHREW was designed to be a low tax, rewards token and features a 0% buy and transfer tax with a 10% sell tax. Simply hold Shiba Rewards to received the BSC pair of SHIB in your wallet with each sell transaction. With a number of Shiba / Floki inspired coins with high taxes with the largest percentage going towards the developers, Shiba Rewards aims to change that by valuing the investors most. ",

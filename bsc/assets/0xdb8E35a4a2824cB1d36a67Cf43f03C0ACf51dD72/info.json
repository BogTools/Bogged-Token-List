  "description": "Socialudo is a basic ludo game which is playable on the blockchain. Each dice thrown on Socialudo is randomly generated with Chainlink VRF. The winning player of the game receives LUDO tokens. A 5% deduction is made for each transaction. 2% of this deduction is redistributed to all beneficiaries as a reward. The more $LUDOâ€™s you have in your wallet, the more rewards you will receive. All beneficiaries are rewarded at the rate of $LUDO in their wallet. 1% of this deduction is burning. The remainder (2%) feeds $LUDO liquidity, preventing inflation and increasing the $LUDO value.",

  "description": "The KPI Token vision arose out of the ideas of our community members, who proposed innovative ways to compare the business metrics and to understand the performance of strategies and processes. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI Token) aims to provide necessary insights to help the users understand how organizations compare the standard processes with similar organizations, even if they are in a different business or have a different group of customers. KPI Token helps organizations and individuals to identify areas, systems or processes for improvements. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI Token) is defined as a program of measuring the processes of (digital) assets and (digital) services against those of organisations known to be leaders in one or more aspects of their operations.",
